Example Batch Delete Strategy
sql
WHILE 1=1
BEGIN
    DELETE TOP (10000) FROM YourTable WHERE <filter conditions>;

    IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
        BREAK;

    -- Optional pause to ease I/O pressure
    WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:01';
END
Let me know if you're curious about optimizing batch sizes, parallel processing, or how this fits into your data architecture. There‚Äôs a whole dark art behind tuning these kinds of ops üòè

the database is in simple mode
Ah, that changes the dynamics a bit‚Äîgood catch. üòé

With the Simple Recovery Model, SQL Server doesn't log every operation for point-in-time recovery like it does in Full Recovery. So in theory, deleting billions of rows should be easier because:

üßπ Minimal Logging: You don‚Äôt get the overhead of extensive transaction log growth.

‚è≥ Faster Completion: There's less waiting for log writes to disk.

BUT, batching is still recommended‚Äîand often necessary‚Äîbecause:

üß† The Limits of ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù
Log Still Matters Even in simple mode, SQL Server still uses the transaction log for active transactions. So if you delete billions in one go, the log can still balloon during that time.

Locking and Blocking Persist You‚Äôll still face the same risks around row/table locks, escalation, and concurrency bottlenecks. SQL Server doesn‚Äôt stop caring about resource contention just because the recovery model is more relaxed.

System Stability A single massive delete can hammer disk I/O, consume loads of memory, and saturate CPU‚Äîputting your entire SQL instance at risk of throttling or downtime.

Rollback Risks If the delete fails halfway through, the rollback still has to be logged and processed‚Äîwhich can be brutal with billions of rows.

üí° So Why Batch Even in Simple Mode?
You‚Äôre doing it to stay nimble and keep control:

Smaller transactions = faster log clearance

Less locking = happier concurrent processes

Easier error handling & recovery mid-process

If you're working with partitions, indexing strategies, or considering switching from DELETE to TRUNCATE or even DROP/CREATE for staging tables, I can walk you through those options too. You‚Äôre clearly knee-deep in high-volume data ops‚Äîhappy to dive deeper.

show me a simple delete in batches of say 2000 for a stored procedure to run and delete then do a loop for a plain delete in batches of 2000
Certainly, Shaun. Here‚Äôs a concise example of a stored procedure in SQL Server that deletes rows in batches of 2000 using a looping construct. This can be adapted depending on your filtering needs or table schema.

üóÉÔ∏è Basic Batched DELETE in a Stored Procedure
Let‚Äôs assume your table is called BigTable and you want to delete rows that meet a certain condition.

sql
CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteInBatches
AS
BEGIN
    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    DECLARE @BatchSize INT = 2000;

    WHILE 1 = 1
    BEGIN
        DELETE TOP (@BatchSize)
        FROM BigTable
        WHERE <your_conditions_here>;

        IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
            BREAK;

        -- Optional: give SQL Server a short breather
        WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:01';
    END
END
üìå How to Use It
To execute the stored procedure:

sql
EXEC DeleteInBatches;
If you don‚Äôt need a condition and just want to delete all rows in batches (effectively a full purge), you could simplify the WHERE clause or omit it entirely:

sql
DELETE TOP (@BatchSize)
FROM BigTable;
Let me know if you want to add logging, limit it to a time window, include transaction control, or adjust for partitioned tables. I can help tailor it to your exact use case!

the prodeure receives a value say fen... and it will delete everything called fen but i want the loop above that not in the sp the sp is a vndor sp
Got it‚Äîyou're working with a vendor-supplied stored procedure that you can't modify, and that proc deletes based on a parameter like 'fen'. What you need is a wrapper loop outside the stored procedure that calls it repeatedly in manageable batches. Here's a streamlined way to do that:

üîÅ Looping Around a Vendor Stored Procedure
Assuming the vendor SP is called Vendor_DeleteProcedure and takes a parameter @Value, you'd write something like:

sql
DECLARE @BatchSize INT = 2000;
DECLARE @RowCount INT = 1;  -- Seed with a non-zero value to enter the loop
DECLARE @Value NVARCHAR(50) = 'fen';

WHILE @RowCount > 0
BEGIN
    EXEC Vendor_DeleteProcedure @Value;

    -- Assuming you can somehow check rows affected (depends on how the SP returns info)
    SET @RowCount = @@ROWCOUNT;  -- This works only if the SP exposes it properly

    -- Optional: give system breathing room
    WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:01';
END
‚ö†Ô∏è A Few Considerations
If Vendor_DeleteProcedure doesn‚Äôt expose @@ROWCOUNT or any return value, you might need an alternate way to monitor progress‚Äîe.g., querying the table after each pass.

You could wrap this logic in your own controller proc if needed.

If performance is tight and you want more control, ask whether the vendor can add a batch parameter to their proc. Otherwise, you‚Äôre stuck managing execution rate from your side.
