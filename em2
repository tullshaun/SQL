Subject: High CPU Conflict Between SolarWinds and Microsoft Defender — Request for Engineering Analysis



Dear SolarWinds Support,



We have confirmed a repeatable conflict between SolarWinds pollers and Microsoft Defender Antivirus, resulting in sustained 100% CPU usage and, in some cases, Defender service failure. The issue does not occur when Defender is disabled or when using Trend Micro antivirus under identical conditions.









Summary of Findings





All SolarWinds pollers experience CPU spikes to 100% whenever Defender is enabled.
Example affected servers: VMAPPQ259, VMAPPQ223, and VMAPPQ259 (tested with Defender toggled on/off).
These are standard pollers, not heavily overloaded.

When using Trend Micro + SolarWinds, CPU utilization remains stable — confirming the issue is specific to Defender’s interaction with SolarWinds.
The behavior suggests Defender is continuously scanning or locking a SolarWinds executable or related file, causing resource contention.
With Defender disabled, CPU returns to normal immediately.
When re-enabled, the issue recurs and Defender’s service sometimes crashes.
Given this, we would have expected your internal testing to show the same behavior under Defender-enabled environments.

The most affected host (VMAPPQ223) consistently reached 100% CPU before Defender terminated unexpectedly.










Next Steps / Request





Please escalate this to your engineering or security response team for analysis.

We specifically need:



Confirmation whether SolarWinds processes or directories are known to conflict with Defender’s real-time protection or network inspection.
Any official or tested Defender exclusion list for SolarWinds components.
Guidance on whether this issue has been logged or patched in recent Orion Platform updates.




We will continue collecting Defender event logs and performance data from all pollers to assist your investigation.
