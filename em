Subject: URGENT: Request for Official Microsoft Defender Exclusion List – Performance Impact Across SolarWinds Environment

Dear SolarWinds Support,

We are escalating an ongoing issue affecting performance and stability across our SolarWinds deployment. Analysis indicates the root cause may involve Microsoft Defender’s real-time and EDR scanning of SolarWinds application and data directories.

Given that we operate within a high-security corporate banking environment, our security team cannot apply exclusions without formal vendor documentation specifying exactly which files, folders, and processes require exclusion.

It is our expectation that SolarWinds, as the product vendor, can provide an authoritative, version-specific list of antivirus/EDR exclusions necessary to ensure optimal and supported operation.

Please provide the following as a matter of urgency:

The official Microsoft Defender exclusion list for SolarWinds ([insert product name and version, e.g., Orion Platform 2023.4]).

Any known advisories or best-practice documentation covering antivirus/EDR compatibility, particularly with Defender.

Confirmation of whether these exclusions are mandatory for maintaining vendor-supported performance levels.

Without this information, our ability to stabilize the platform and comply with internal security governance requirements is severely limited.

We appreciate your immediate attention to this request and ask that you treat this as a priority escalation.
