Dear SolarWinds Support,

Thank you for your previous response. At this stage, we need to be very clear — this issue is impacting our live SolarWinds monitoring environment and requires immediate action.

We are not seeking general best-practice guidance. What is urgently required is a specific, vendor-certified exclusion list for Microsoft Defender/EDR, detailing the exact files, folders, and processes that must be excluded for our installed version ([insert version, e.g. Orion Platform 2023.4]).

We are a corporate bank, not a software testing lab.
We lack the internal source code and behavioral knowledge of the SolarWinds product to “assess” which files are safe to exclude — this is SolarWinds’ fundamental responsibility as the software vendor.

This is critical for the following reasons:

Microsoft Defender is a primary enterprise antivirus platform, and as a major vendor, SolarWinds should already be testing product compatibility against it as part of standard QA.

Our security and compliance teams cannot approve any exclusions without a formally documented and engineering-validated list from SolarWinds.

It is not feasible to escalate internally to management or security governance with a position that “SolarWinds does not know what needs to be excluded.”

Please confirm:

When SolarWinds will deliver a formal, version-specific AV exclusion document suitable for regulated enterprise environments.

The expected timeline for its delivery, as this directly impacts our ability to maintain live monitoring operations.

We appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and request this be escalated to Tier 3 Engineering or Product Management for a definitive response.
