Subject: URGENT: Request for Official Microsoft Defender Exclusion List – Performance Impact Across SolarWinds Environment

Dear SolarWinds Support,

We are escalating an ongoing issue affecting performance and stability across our SolarWinds deployment. Analysis indicates the root cause may involve Microsoft Defender’s real-time and EDR scanning of SolarWinds application and data directories.

Given that we operate within a high-security corporate banking environment, our security team cannot apply exclusions without formal vendor documentation specifying exactly which files, folders, and processes require exclusion.

It is our expectation that SolarWinds, as the product vendor, can provide an authoritative, version-specific list of antivirus/EDR exclusions necessary to ensure optimal and supported operation.

Please provide the following as a matter of urgency:

The official Microsoft Defender exclusion list for SolarWinds ([insert product name and version, e.g., Orion Platform 2023.4]).

Any known advisories or best-practice documentation covering antivirus/EDR compatibility, particularly with Defender.

Confirmation of whether these exclusions are mandatory for maintaining vendor-supported performance levels.

Without this information, our ability to stabilize the platform and comply with internal security governance requirements is severely limited.

We appreciate your immediate attention to this request and ask that you treat this as a priority escalation.


Dear SolarWinds Support,

Thank you for your recent response and the link to the KB article “Files and directories to exclude from antivirus scanning for Orion Platform products” (Updated Jan 31, 2025).

Unfortunately, the information provided is too generic for our environment and does not meet the documentation standards required for implementation within a highly regulated corporate banking network.

To proceed, we require clear, vendor-backed guidance specifying:

The exact files, folders, and processes that must be excluded from Microsoft Defender/EDR scanning.

Which exclusions are mandatory to ensure supported performance and stability.

Confirmation that these recommendations are validated by SolarWinds engineering and applicable to our installed version – [insert version, e.g. Orion Platform 2023.4].

Any supporting documentation (e.g. enterprise deployment guide, whitepaper, or security advisory) used for similar high-security customers.

Our internal security and compliance teams cannot approve exclusions without formal vendor documentation clearly stating what is required and officially supported. The current KB article only references general best practices and does not provide the level of specificity necessary for risk-assessed implementation.

Please escalate this request to Tier 3 Engineering or the Product Team so we can obtain an authoritative response. This issue is currently impacting operational stability, and we require definitive exclusion guidance to move forward.
